============================
TESTING
============================

Both the single threaded implementation (main.c) and the multithreaded (main_threading.c) have been tested
extensively on Ubuntu 14.04. All tests were done manually. Both servers were tested with multiple strings of
length less than 512 bytes, equal to 511 bytes, equal to 512 bytes, equal to 513 bytes, and equal to values
much larger than 512. The multithreaded implementation was tested with with the same strings as the single-
threaded tests with multiple terminal windows. Tests were also performed using various ports and various IP
addresses.

============================
EXTRA CREDIT
============================

The server is implemented with multithreading to support multiple client connections at once in main_threading.c.
This implementation uses pthreads, so the file must be compiled with the following command:

gcc -pthread main_threading.c
